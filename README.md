# Nodes-IO
Blender 2.75 node trees importer / exporter

<h4>About the add-on</h4>
The add-on is created to supply users with a way to create a light-weight library for their materials and all other type of node trees. Be it shaders, compositing or world nodes, Nodes-IO supports it all since 2.75.

Nodes attributes such as height, width, label, color, position and values are preserved adequately.
All file formats are also converted to binary for maximized space usage efficiency.

<ul>
The files formats are:
  <li><b>mat</b>: shader node tree (either Blender Internal or Cycles)</li>
  <li><b>cmp</b>: compositor node tree</li>
  <li><b>wrld</b>: world node tree</li>
</uL>
